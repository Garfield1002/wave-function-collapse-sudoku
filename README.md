## âš™ Library

The animation was made using [Haskell reanimate](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/reanimate). With a lot of help from the [N-queen problem article](https://williamyaoh.com/posts/2020-05-31-reanimate-nqueens-tutorial.html).

## ðŸ©¹ Limitations

This visualization however isn't perfect as it does not show off the stack or any backtracking.
